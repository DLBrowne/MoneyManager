# MoneyManager
A personal finance app for Windows 10 devices

# Details

Example of a UWP app for personal finance. Contains a side panel with links to different pages, where the user can check and add transactions, debts, accounts and categories.

There are some problems with the implementation, mostly with the non-reutilization of the code.
